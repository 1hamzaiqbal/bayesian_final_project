Bonus
Finally, for the remainder of the project, take this initial investigation into a new direction of
your choosing. There is considerable flexibility here, and some examples are below. I obviously
don’t expect you to do all of these or even any of these if you have a different idea:
• Investigate different objectives or a different task.
• Implement more acquisition functions and compare their performance with ei and random
search as above. There are numerous options out there!
• Investigate how the performance of Bayesian optimization changes if after every observation
we relearn the model’s hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood.
• Investigate batch Bayesian optimization. What if we select multiple points at once? There
are numerous acquisition functions for implementing such a policy.
• Investigate how Bayesian optimization performs in the face of observation noise. You can
simulate this noise by adding random noise with a given variance into each observation.
Does noise slow us down? How much?
Please write a (at-least) one-page report on this final part, including your idea and your findings.
